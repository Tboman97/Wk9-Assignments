<ul>
<li>
3 citations, APA formatted for your paper (you will have done this in Monday's class and this will help for the paper that is due the following Monday).

<li>
 A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. </li>
