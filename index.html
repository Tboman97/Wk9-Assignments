<p>There are several pieces to the assessment to receive all 5 points -- all of which will be submitted through Github  by Wed., 10/30/19 - (to be done via a webpage based on a template from our Wk9-Assignments github or you can structure your own page if you'd prefer, but it must include all of these elements), with different headings for the different sections include the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>
3 citations, APA formatted for your paper (you will have done this in Monday's class and this will help for the paper that is due the following Monday).

<li>
 A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. </li>
<li>A "description list" with the 4 aspects of computational thinking listed & briefly summarized (see: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl</a> for more on the <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></pre>element)</li>
<li>Begin the Javascript Intro & write 3 quiz questions from these section of reading at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction</a> &amp; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types">& https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types</a>, also using the <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></pre> for each question and answer</li>
</ul>

<!-- 2.)A short (1 to 3 paragaph) reflection in a webpage (via <pre style="display:inline;"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> marking up a section of your page, for example) on how libraries support student research in the internet age. Include what you learned from Monday's class. -->
 <h5>Class Reflection</h5>
 <p>
	In class on 10/28 I learned that the library has more resources than just books. For example, they have a whole online catalogue that I was unaware of. Something interesting that you can do with that catalogue is look-up what books the CCSU library has as well as what books 
	other Connecticut public libraries have. I saw an example of this today when we looked up a famous author and CCSU did not have the book we were looking for, but Southern Connecticut State University's library did. 
	<br>Libraries support student research in the internet age by giving students a huge database full of credible sources to work from. When students are doing research they can look to that database for websites, books, newspapers, videos, and more that can help them. I think it is interesting that the 
	library's database can be used for more than just phsyical books and I think it greatly helps student research.
